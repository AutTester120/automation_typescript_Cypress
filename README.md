# automation_typescript

In this repository you find a project step by step where I implement automation testing in Trello app, the framework used is Cypress with Typescript as a language of programming.

If you want to run this project  you need to do a fork of this repository, then clone this repository in your local directory  and create a file in this directory "../cypress.env.json", it must be as the example shown before. You also could download the main branch of this repository and copy it to a local directory. 

Example of environment credentials:
```
{
  "email": "example@email.com",
  "pw": "Password",
  "token": "",
  "key": "",
  "invalidEmail": "example@email.com"",
  "invalidPw": "invalid password",
  "errorMessage": "Incorrect email address and / or password.", // you must copy this field
  "userName": "username of Trello"

}
```

I'd be happy if you leave me any observations or feedback.

Happy Coding...
